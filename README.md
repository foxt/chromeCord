## PRIVACY

You might want to check the `config.json` for privacy settings because, even in incognito, it still pushes the Discord presence, You could always just close the script though.

## FAQ


#### Why does it take 15 seconds for sites to update?

Discord limits how often we can send updates.

#### Help! It keeps saying `Error: Could not connect`

This 9/10 times, usually means Discord isn't open.

Make sure you're using the desktop version, not the web site.
